# Notes-for-Statistical-Science

Notes based on some of my undergraduate Stats major courses since the summer between Yr2 and Yr 3 as well as notes I learn during my research;) Since this is the subjects that I began to use LaTeX, and English is not my mother tongue, sry for the typos in advance.

- [Methods for Data Analysis](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes-for-Statistical-Science/blob/main/Methods%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20I%20%26%20II/STA302%20Lecture%20Notes.pdf) : This note would construnct fundamental understanding of linear regression model including but not limit to its assumptions, formulars(based on OLS) and parameter inferences. 

- [Methods for Data Analysis II](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes-for-Statistical-Science/blob/main/Methods%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20I%20%26%20II/STA303%20Lecture%20Notes.pdf) : Based real life situations, this notes expand the using of linear regression model by introducing GLM(Generalized Linear Model), LMM(Linear Mixed Model) and GLMM(Generalized Linear Mixed Model, for Poisson/Binary/Gamma distributed dependent variables). ANOVA and Likelyhood Ratio test included as well. 

- [Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes-for-Statistical-Science/blob/main/Surveys,%20Sampling%20and%20Observational%20Data/STA304%20Lecture%20Notes.tex) : This notes indicateds how to make proper estimations based on survey data. 

- [Probability](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes-for-Statistical-Science/blob/main/Probability/STA347%20Lecture%20notes.tex) : Strengthen understanding of each distributions by proofs and derivations. 

- Statistical Computation: （fixing）


Best,
